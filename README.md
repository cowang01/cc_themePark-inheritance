Classes and Abstract Classes

Look through the start code and understand what is set up for you already.

Visitor class with age, height and money.
Attraction abstract class with name, rating and visitCount (which starts at 0).
Rollercoaster, Dodgems, Park and Playground classes which inherit from Attraction
Stall abstract class which has name, owner name, rating and parking spot.
CandyFlossStall. TobaccoStall and IceCreamStall which inherit from Stall.
All of these classes have tests set up for them.

Interfaces

Introduce some Interfaces to enable charging, restricting and reviewing attractions and stalls:

ITicketed promises double defaultPrice() and double priceFor(Visitor)

ISecurity promises boolean isAllowedTo(Visitor)

IReviewed promises int getRating() and String getName()

Have some of the classes implement these interfaces. Below are the rules about what the implementations should be:

Playground implements ISecurity because it has a maximum age of 15

TobaccoStall implements ISecurity because it has a minimum age of 18

Rollercoster implements ISecurity and requires a visitor to be over 145cm tall and over 12 years of age

All Stalls and Attractions implement IReviewed.

Note: Starting prices are:

£8.40 for Rollercoaster
£4.50 for Dodgems
Rollercoaster implements ITicketed and charges tall people over 200cm double fee
Dodgems implements ITicketed and charge half price to children under 12 years old
Extensions

Create a ThemePark class to manage the attractions and stalls.

ThemePark stores all Attractions and Stalls in it.
ThemePark has a method getAllReviewed() which returns an ArrayList of IReviewed objects.
Add an empty visitedAttractions ArrayList to Visitor which stores a list of Attractions and a method to add an attraction to the list.
ThemePark has a method visit(Visitor, Attraction) calls for the attraction to increment its visitCount by 1 and adds the attraction to the visitors visitedAttractions list.
Advanced Extensions

ThemePark has a method that can return a new HashMap<String, Integer> with all reviews. The HashMap will have a key of the name and value of review.
ThemePark has a method getAllAllowedFor(Visitor) which takes a Visitor and returns an ArrayList of ISecurity that the visitor is allowed to go on.
